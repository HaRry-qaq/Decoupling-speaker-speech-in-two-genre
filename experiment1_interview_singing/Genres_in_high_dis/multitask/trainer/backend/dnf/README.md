# DNF (Discriminative normalization flow)
A Pytorch implementation of DNF embedding normalization.

The neural network structure is based on "Masked Autoregressive Flow", and the source code from [ikostrikov](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-flows/blob/master/README.md)

## Run DNF
```bash
python train.py
```
The evaluation and scoring will be performed automatically during the training process.

## Other instructions
```bash
score.py : a Python implementation of the standard Kaldi cosine scoring, you can also use kaldi to make plda scoring.
tsne.py  : a visualization toolkit by t-SNE to draw the distribution of latent space. 
```
